    "**Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python**: Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in data science. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks specifically designed for data analysis, such as NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy. Python's simplicity, versatility, and extensive community support make it a popular choice among data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R**: R is another popular language among data scientists, particularly in the field of statistical analysis. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling. R has a strong community and a wide range of packages like ggplot2 and dplyr that make it suitable for statistical analysis and data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL**: While not a programming language in the traditional sense, SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with relational databases. Data scientists often use SQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data stored in databases. SQL is crucial for querying large datasets efficiently and performing database operations.\n"
